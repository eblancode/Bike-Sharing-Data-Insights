# Bike-Sharing-Data-Insights
This project has been developed using python for the backend, sql for the database and power bi as a platform for the frontend. 
The data is coming from https://citybik.es/, a repository of all the bike-sharing sevices around the world.
Using the python scripts we can get real-time data and store it to the database we can generate with the .sql files.
It is currently set up so that it gets data from Bicing service from Barcelona, to get data from other bike services the code have to be changed accordingly.

The aim of this project is to compute a first approach of a real-time data analysis going through all the steps, from the raw data to the data visualization.

Many thanks to my work-mates Nil Noya and Marc Roig.
